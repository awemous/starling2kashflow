Converts Starling bank csv files into something that Kashflow can import

Convert Starling Bank CSV format to be imported by Kashflow

Motivation
I recently signed up to the Starling Bank Business account. Kashflow does not natively connect to Starling which is a huge bummer. Despite a writing campaign to Kashflow and Starling they continue to ignore the problem. I found this https://github.com/mafonso/starling2freeagent and adjusted it to work for Kashflow. Thanks mafonso for sending me down the right path.

Kashflow docs on csv import are here: https://www.kashflow.com/support/kb/bankfeeds-csv



## Usage
Start with a CSV statment generated by Starling Bank. The current CSV format is this:

```$ cat sample.csv
Date,Counter Party,Reference,Type,Amount (GBP),Balance (GBP)
,Opening Balance,,,,0.00
31/03/2018,Starling Bank,March Interest Earned,INTEREST PAYMENT,0.02,0.02
03/04/2018,Company A,INVOICE 12345,CHAPS,1250.50,1250.52
03/04/2018,Company B,BILL 54312,CHAPS,-500.20,750.30
```

Then run

```./s2k.py sample.csv```

This will generate a Kashflow version of the file with the prefix kash-

```$ cat kash-sample.csv
MoneyIn,MoneyOut,Date,Description,Reference
31/03/2018,0.02,,March Interest Earned,INTEREST PAYMENT
03/04/2018,1250.50,,INVOICE 12345,CHAPS
03/04/2018,,-500.20,BILL 54312,CHAPS
```
